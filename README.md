# PowerShell-AWS
Here are a list of PowerShell Scripts interacting with AWS resources that I have authored. It is really fun to watch script interact with AWS resources to prepare them as necessary. 

To run these scripts, first you must have AWS SDK installed on your PowerShell and have authorization over the AWS resources that you want to interact with. 

Please make sure that you understand the script before running them because certain scripts will delete everyting across every region of your AWS account.
